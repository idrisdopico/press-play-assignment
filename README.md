# PressPlay assignment
## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `yarn` in the root directory
3. Run `yarn ios` or `yarn android` to start the app

## Notes
- I've use [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/) for the project, this makes starting up the project easier
- I've used [react-native-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started) for navigation and the tabs
- I've used [react-native-vector-icons]() for icons
- The app is tested on iOS only
- The linter is not configured correctly, I've tried to fix it, but I couldn't get it to work. I've left it in the project, maybe we can figure out what's wrong with it together.
- It's taken me about 10 hours to complete the assignment.
